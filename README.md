### Encapsulation
```
This property hides unnecessary details and makes it easier to manage the program
structure. Each object’s implementation and state are hidden behind well-defined
boundaries and that provides a clean and simple interface for working with them. One way
to accomplish this is by making the data private.
```

### Inheritance
```
Inheritance, also called generalization, allows us to capture a hierarchal relationship
between classes and objects. For instance, a ‘fruit’ is a generalization of ‘orange’.
Inheritance is very useful from a code reuse perspective.
```

### Abstraction
```
This property allows us to hide the details and expose only the essential features of a
concept or object. For example, a person driving a scooter knows that on pressing a horn,
sound is emitted, but he has no idea about how the sound is actually generated on pressing
the horn.
```

### Polymorphism
```
Poly-morphism means many forms. That is, a thing or action is present in different forms
or ways. One good example of polymorphism is constructor overloading in classes.
